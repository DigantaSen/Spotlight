---### 🎯 Educational Features- Both players receive positive payoffs



## 🏆 Nash Equilibrium Analysis- **Real-Time Nash Equilibrium Analysis**: Instant feedback on equilibrium status- Neither player can improve by unilaterally changing strategy



### Nash Equilibrium: Stop vs Stop (0,0)- **Complete Game Theory Breakdown**: All 9 possible outcomes explained- Represents cooperative behavior with mutual benefit



**Why is (Stop, Stop) an equilibrium?**- **Strategic Learning Tools**: Understand optimal play patterns



1. ✅ **Player 1 cannot improve**: - **Visual Payoff Display**: Clear representation of outcomes### 📈 Strategic Analysis

   - Current payoff: 0 (Stop)

   - If switches to Go: -1 (worse - collision with P2's Go!)- **Interactive Tutorial**: Learn by playing- **Go vs Go (-1,-1)**: Mutual aggression leads to collision/penalty

   - **Conclusion**: Switching makes P1 worse off

- **Mixed outcomes**: Asymmetric payoffs when players choose different strategies

2. ✅ **Player 2 cannot improve**:

   - Current payoff: 0 (Stop)### 📊 Payoff Matrix- **Stop vs Stop (0,0)**: Safe but non-optimal mutual caution

   - If switches to Go: -1 (worse - collision with P1's Go!)

   - **Conclusion**: Switching makes P2 worse off



3. ✅ **Mutual stability**: Neither player has incentive to deviate unilaterally```## How to Play

4. ✅ **Safety**: Both players avoid negative payoffs

5. ✅ **Risk aversion**: Rational players prioritize safety over uncertain gain                Player 2



**Important Note:**            Go     Caution    Stop1. **Choose Game Mode**: Select Human vs Computer or Human vs Human

While (Stop, Stop) is the Nash Equilibrium, it's **not Pareto optimal**. Both players could theoretically earn higher payoffs (one gets 3, other gets -1) if they could coordinate perfectly. However, without coordination, the risk of collision (-1, -1) makes Stop the rational choice!

- **Recognition**: Learn to identify stable vs unstable outcomes| Stop-Caution | 0 | 2 | ❌ | P2 benefits |

- **Application**: Understand why certain behaviors persist in real-world scenarios| Stop-Stop | 0 | 0 | ❌ | Mutual avoidance |



### 2. Strategic Thinking---

- **Payoff Analysis**: Evaluate consequences of each choice

- **Best Response**: Determine optimal action given opponent's strategy## 🎮 How to Play

- **Risk Assessment**: Balance potential gains against potential losses

### Step 1: Choose Game Mode

### 3. Game Theory Applications- **Human vs Computer**: Practice against AI

Real-world scenarios modeled by this game:- **Human vs Human**: Play with a friend locally

- **Traffic Management**: When to proceed vs yield at intersections

- **Economic Competition**: When to compete vs cooperate in markets### Step 2: Make Your Choice

- **Resource Allocation**: When to conserve vs exploit shared resources- 🟢 **Go** - Aggressive strategy (higher risk/reward)

- **Social Dilemmas**: Understanding cooperation in prisoner's dilemma-like situations- 🟡 **Caution** - Balanced strategy (moderate payoff)

- 🔴 **Stop** - Defensive strategy (safe but lower payoff)

---

### Step 3: View Results

## 💡 What is Nash Equilibrium?- See your choice and opponent's choice

- View payoffs for both players

A **Nash Equilibrium** is a solution concept in game theory where:- Read Nash Equilibrium analysis

- Understand why the outcome is/isn't stable

1. **No Unilateral Improvement**: No player can increase their payoff by changing only their own strategy

2. **Mutual Best Responses**: Each player's strategy is optimal given others' strategies### Step 4: Learn & Strategize

3. **Self-Enforcing Stability**: The outcome persists because deviating is not beneficial- Study the complete game analysis

- Identify optimal strategies

**Example in this game:**- Play again to test your strategy!

- If both players choose Stop, neither benefits from switching to Go alone

- Switching to Go when opponent Stops gives +3, but if both Go, both get -1---

- The fear of collision makes Stop the rational choice when uncertain

## 🧠 Game Theory Concepts Demonstrated

## 💡 What is Nash Equilibrium?

### 1. Dominant Strategy

Neither player has a dominant strategy in this game:A **Nash Equilibrium** is a solution concept where:

- Go is better if opponent Stops (+3 vs 0)1. **No Unilateral Improvement**: No player can increase their payoff by changing only their own strategy

- Stop is better if opponent Goes (0 vs -1)2. **Mutual Best Responses**: Each player's strategy is optimal given others' strategies

- Decision depends on prediction of opponent's choice3. **Stability**: The outcome is self-enforcing



### 2. Pareto Efficiency---

(Stop, Stop) is Pareto inefficient:

- Both players get 0## 🔧 Technical Implementation

- One player could get 3 (at cost of other getting -1)

- But risk of both getting -1 prevents this- **HTML5** - Semantic structure

- **CSS3** - Modern styling with flexbox/grid

### 3. Coordination Problem- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Pure JS, no dependencies

Players face a coordination challenge:- **Game Theory Algorithms** - Nash equilibrium computation

- Without communication, safety (Stop) prevails

- With coordination, exploitation (one Go, one Stop) possible---

- Perfect coordination impossible without trust
